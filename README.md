LiveStream is a data holder class which can observe change of data in real-time and emit values too. Here's emitter subscriber pattern. It's developed in pure Dart.

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Getting Started

### Add Dependency
Add below dependency in [`pubspec.yaml`](pubspec.yaml).

```yml
dependencies:
  livestream: ^1.0.0
```

### Initialize `LiveStream` Instance
You can create instance as below.

```dart
  LiveStream liveStream = new LiveStream();
```

### Subscribe to Stream / Add Observer
`LiveStream` event will be dispatched when data is changed. See below code to add observer / subscriber.

```dart
    liveStream.on("chat-message", (message) {
      print("Message Received: $message");
    });
```
Whenever data is emitted to `chat-message` channel/stream above block will be executed.

### Emitting Events or Broadcasting
The main idea behind `LiveStream` is that you can send and receive any events you want, with any data you want. Any objects that can be encoded as JSON will do, and binary data is supported too. See code below.

```dart
  void send() {
      String message = "Hi there!";
      liveStream.emit("chat-message", message);
  }
```
